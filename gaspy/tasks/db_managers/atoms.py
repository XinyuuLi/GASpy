    This function will dump all of the completed FireWorks into our `atoms` Mongo
    collection. It will not dump anything that is already there.

    You may notice some functions with the term "patched" in them. If you are
    using GASpy and not in the Ulissigroup, then you can probably skip all the
    patching by not calling the `__patch_old_document` function at all.

    Args:
        n_processes     An integer indicating how many threads you want to use
                        when converting FireWorks into Mongo documents. If you
                        do not expect many updates, stick to the default of 1.
                        If you are re-creating your collection from a full
                        FireWorks database, you may want to increase this
                        argument.
